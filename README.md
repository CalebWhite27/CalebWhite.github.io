Hello! I'm a returning GitHub user!

I created an account and downloaded Github. Then on Github's website I made a new Repository and named it: CalebWhite.github.io . After that I went back to the Github website, clicked the + at the top left and clicked on New Repository, named it: CalebWhite.github.io , enabled the README file then clicked Create Repository. After that I clicked on the green button that says Code, and copied the URL it gave me. Next I went back to the Github on my PC. Then I clicked File and clicked on the Clone Repository and went to the URL section and pasted the Link from the Code section on the Github website. Once I got into the next prompt I chose my Github file I made called: CalebWhite.github.io_Clone and named the file that as well and cloned it in there. Once cloned I opened the cloned file and in the README.txt I opened it to type in the steps of my process. (In the downloaded GitHub) I did need to sign in and out in order for the file to connect the GitHub website for some reason.) 

In order for the folder on the PC to read what I typed in here on the website I need to Save the things I wrote in here, then I need to click on the Desktop GitHub "Fetch origin" then click "Commit to main", then open Repsoitry and click "Push", finally I needed to open the website and refresh the page and it will show me my updated writing.
